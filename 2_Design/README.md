## Design

### System Architecture

The **Autonomous System for Detecting Drainage Blockages** is designed with the following modular components:  

1. **Control Unit**  
   - **Raspberry Pi 4** acts as the central hub, connecting sensors, motors, and communication modules.  
   - Handles real-time data processing and control logic.  

2. **Sensors and Detection**  
   - **Ultrasonic Sensors**: Measure distances to detect blockages or obstructions.  
   - **Infrared Cameras**: Capture images of pipe interiors under low light.  
   - **High-Definition Camera**: Provides detailed visuals for advanced blockage detection using computer vision.  

3. **Navigation System**  
   - **GPS Module**: Tracks the robotâ€™s location in large drainage systems.  
   - **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)**: Ensures precise movement and orientation in confined spaces.  

4. **Motor and Power System**  
   - **DC and Stepper Motors**: Drive the robot through narrow pipelines.  
   - **L293D Motor Shield**: Manages motor control.  
   - **Battery Pack**: Provides portable power for the entire system.  

5. **Communication Module**  
   - **Bluetooth Module**: Enables wireless communication between the robot and the operator.  

6. **Software Stack**  
   - **Computer Vision**: Detects blockages using OpenCV and pre-trained neural networks.  
   - **Neural Network Model**: Processes visual data for precise blockage identification.  
   - **Navigation Algorithms**: Ensure smooth movement and obstacle avoidance.
